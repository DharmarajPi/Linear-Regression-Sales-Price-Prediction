#Simple Linear Regression Project

1.Introduction
In this project, I build a Simple Linear Regression model to predict sales price.

2.Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables. This technique is applicable for Supervised Learning Regression problems where we try to predict a continuous variable. Linear Regression can be further classified into two types – Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. In this project, I used Simple Linear Regression technique where I have one independent and one dependent variable.

Equation of linear regression /n
y=c+m1x1+m2x2+...+mnxn 
y - is the response
c - is the intercept
m1 - is the coefficient for the first feature
mn - is the coefficient for the nth feature
In our project:
y=c+m1×TV 
The  m  values are called the model coefficients or model parameters.
